<h1>Online Retail Maintenance Project</h1>

<h3>Background Information</h3>
<p>HappyRetail is a British multinational grocery and general merchandise retailer headquartered in United Kingdom. It is the third largest retailer in the world measured by profits and second-largest retailer in the world measured by revenues. It has stores in 12 countries across Asia and Europe and is the grocery market leader in the UK (where it has a market share of around 30%), the Republic of Ireland, Hungary, Malaysia and Thailand.</p>

Today&#39;s consumers are more demanding than ever. Customers have more choices and purchasing channels than ever before and when they interact with a retailer they want you to know who they are and what they want. To be competitive in today&#39;s demanding multi-channel retail environment, retailers need their retail management systems integrated to deliver enhanced customer service across channels while driving growth and increased revenue.

Leveraging the years of experience in Retail Industry and tapping the potential of eBusiness /ecommerce, HappyRetail has decided to invest in developing state of art, customer friendly, Retail Management Portal. The HappyRetail portal planned to be developed, should focus on the ease of usage, with the homepage showcasing the product categories available to shop online. The navigation should be simple enough so that buyers can view and place orders.

Every customer likes discount. The portal to be developed can announce the latest offers, deals and clearance sale prominently to catch the attention of the casual browsers and convert them into customers.

The planned portal can enhance the shopping experience letting customers shop by their preferred criteria: by category, by brand, by age, by gender, etc. Such website filters, increase the efficiency of the e-store for customers and can save them much time while shopping. For the new comers to the portal, a search box combined with a drop-down list of categories will ensure he finds what he is looking for and ensures his shopping experience is good.

Digi Safari is into education, university, and healthcare. Now it is planning to go for retail business.

Online Retail allows customer to directly buy products over the internet. Manipal has decided to invest in developing state of art, customer friendly for the Retail Business Portal.

This portal would essentially have 2 modules:

1. User Module – Searching for products, adding to shopping cart, buying products, maintaining user profile.
2. Admin Module – Allow to perform adding / maintaining category, adding / maintaining product, adding / maintaining sub category.
